#m3yoyo - m3u editor

Standalone m3u editor that uses localstorage for keeping your file data in your own browser only.

Simple react-app with material-ui, material-tables and m3u8-file-parser.

Uses prebuilt https://github.com/picons/picons for icons.

## Install

Use it directly at https://scotteadams.github.io/m3yoyo/ or build it yourself locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:ScottEAdams/m3yoyo.git
cd m3yoyo
yarn install
yarn start
```

Pull requests welcome!

Some possible future ideas:

- Add built in player in detail panel so you can check the stream
- Add custom columns to insert more tags
- Check against an epg file to make sure id's are correct
